# antGenomeFiles
Various python scripts which are used to analyze and organize genomic data.

The first script: vcfToMst translates data output from [unfiltered VCF](https://vcftools.github.io/index.html) into a format which can be input into [MST_Map](http://www.mstmap.org/) for the creation of linkage maps.

The second script: scaffoldGapFinder is a diagnostic script which reads the output of MSTMap and highlights large linkage groups and significant gaps between scaffolds.

# Necessary tools/APIs
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and [Pandas API](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) must be installed to run these scripts.
